title: Plasma Docker Control
summary: "Applet for KDE Plasma 5 to manage your docker containers and local docker-compose stacks.
I made this for my own convenience to manage my local development setup.
The status of containers and stacks can be controlled directly via the applet.
In addition, the compose file can be edited and log files can be displayed with one click.
It is written with Qt in C++, QML, and JavaScript."
