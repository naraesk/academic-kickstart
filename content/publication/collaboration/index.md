abstract: In 2017 and 2018 we released two of our research prototypes as open source. We explain our motivation and concerns at that time and compare them with our actual experience. We also describe how open source releases enabled collaboration with industrial partners. Finally, we show how research projects can extend their funding through grants for open source software. We share our experiences with the initiative Google Summer of Code and show how we overcame bureaucratical hurdles and how our research has benefited from participating in this program.
