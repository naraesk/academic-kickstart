abstract: By optimizing aesthetics, graph diagrams can be generated that are easier to read and understand. However, the challenge lies in identifying suitable aesthetics. We present a novel approach based on repertory grids to explore the design space of aesthetics systematically. We applied our approach with three independent groups of participants to systematically identify graph aesthetics. In all three cases, we were able to reproduce the aesthetics with positively evaluated influence on readability without any prior knowledge. We also applied our approach to two- and three-dimensional domain-specific software visualizations to demonstrate its versatility. In this case, we were also able to acquire several aesthetics that are relevant for perceiving the visualization.
