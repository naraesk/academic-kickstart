abstract: Software visualizations are used to support stakeholders in software engineering activities like development, project management, and maintenance. The respective tasks determine which aspects of software, i.e., structural, behavioral and/or evolutionary information, need to be visualized. To promote the usage of software visualizations they have to optimally support the needs of the respective stakeholder for the specific task at hand. Therefore, we see the necessity to create innovative visualizations and to optimize existing ones. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to empirically evaluate the different visualizations and their variants. In this paper, we present GETAVIZ as a toolset to support these processes, i.e., designing visualizations, generating task- and role specific visualizations, and conducting empirical evaluations. The toolset implements the concept of generative and model-driven software visualization and makes it possible to generate different visualizations for all three aspects of software. Its strength lies in its adaptability, so that new visualizations and variations of existing ones can be implemented easily. In addition to the generator this toolset contains several extractors for different programming languages, a browser-based user interface for viewing and interacting with visualizations, and an evaluation server to facilitate the execution of local and remote experiments. The paper illustrates the capabilities of GETAVIZ and it discusses plans for its further development.
